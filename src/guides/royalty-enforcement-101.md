# Royalty Enforcement 101

## Policy Rules

To ensure royalty enforcement, the policy for the asset needs to have the following rules:

1. [Lock Rule](./../mysten-kiosk/lock-rule.md)
2. [Personal Kiosk Rule](./../mysten-kiosk/personal-kiosk-rule.md)
3. [Royalty Rule](./../mysten-kiosk/royalty-rule.md)

The minted assets, if the process of minting is handled by the user, have to be locked using the `kiosk::lock` function, see [Locking](./../concepts/locking.md).

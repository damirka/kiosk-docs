# Collection Bidding

Collection Bidding implements the ability to bid on a collection of items. The user can place multiple bids at once, and the seller can accept the bids in the submitted order. For example: "Alice bids 20 SUI and 10 SUI, Bob has to accept the 10 SUI bid before the 20 SUI bid." The seller resolves both transfer requests: for the Market and for the creator of the item.

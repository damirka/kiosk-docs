# Setting a Policy

Similarly to how creators can set a policy for their assets, marketplaces can set a policy for trades too. The policy can be set to enforce any rules creators can set for their assets, such as royalties, floor prices, or lock rules. Just like creators' policies, the marketplace policy can be set to collect any transaction fees.

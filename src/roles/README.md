# Roles

As an ecosystem Kiosk defines 3 major roles and sets the rules of interaction between them. The roles are: **Creator**, **Kiosk Owner**, and **Buyer**. Each of the roles has a set of advantages and limitations - the former is the available functionality and the latter is the set of constraints that allows other roles to function.

In this section we go through all of the roles in detail and describe their interactions.

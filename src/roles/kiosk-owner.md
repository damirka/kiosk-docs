# Kiosk Owner

Anyone on the network can create a Kiosk and use it to store and trade assets. The Kiosk Owner is the owner of the `KioskOwnerCap` - a special object that grants full access to a single Kiosk.

Kiosk Owner can:

- [Place and take items](./../kiosk/place-and-take.md)
- [List items for sale](./../kiosk/list-and-purchase.md)
- [Add and remove Extensions](./../kiosk-extensions/README.md)
- [Withdraw profits from sales](./../kiosk/withdrawing-profits.md)
- [Borrow and mutate owned assets](./../kiosk/borrowing.md)
- Access full arsenal of trading tools (eg auctions, lotteries, collection bidding etc)

Kiosk provides a set of guarantees to the Kiosk Owner:

- **Safety** - no other party can access items or profits stored in the Kiosk
- **Liquidity** - the Kiosk can be used to trade assets globally on the network
- **Ownership** - traded items never leave the Kiosk and are owned by the Kiosk Owner until the sale is complete

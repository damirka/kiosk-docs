# What is Kiosk

Kiosk is a decentralized, non-custodial, low-level protocol for storing and trading digital assets. It is designed to be used by creators, marketplaces, and developers to create and enforce rules for trading digital assets. It provides ownership guarantees to users, policy enforcement guarantees to creators, and trading functionality and a single ecosystem to marketplaces.

Kiosk is native to Sui, and is a part of the Sui Framework. As such, it is widely supported by the Sui ecosystem, and can be used to own and trade assets on the Sui blockchain.

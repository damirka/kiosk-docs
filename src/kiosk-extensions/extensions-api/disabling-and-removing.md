# Disabling and Removing

Any extension can be disabled by the Kiosk Owner at any time. This will revoke all permissions of the extension and prevent it from performing any actions in the Kiosk. The extension can be re-enabled at any time by the Kiosk Owner.

> Disabling an extension does not remove it from the Kiosk. An installed Extension will always have access to its storage.

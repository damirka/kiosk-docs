# Demo Applications
Currently, there are two public demo applications for Kiosk: “Kiosk Demo” and “Kiosk CLI” both of which can be used as code references for building custom client applications. 

## Kiosk Demo
This demo application illustrates a simple list / purchase flow built with TypeScript, React and Kiosk SDK. 

- Live: interactive version is available at: https://sui-kiosk.vercel.app/
- Code: the code is located in the Sui repository under the [dapps/kiosk](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/dapps/kiosk) 

## Kiosk CLI
This application implements Kiosk functionality as a pure JavaScript, showing best practices for each of the actions.

- Code: the code is located in the Sui repository under the [dapps/kiosk-cli](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/dapps/kiosk-cli) path

## Future
More demo applications are coming, the flows that are not currently covered but will be are:
- Creator demo - creating and setting up a TransferPolicy to enable asset trading in Kiosks
- Marketplace demo - setting up a Marketplace with the upcoming Marketplace Extension

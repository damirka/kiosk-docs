# Extensions

Kiosk Extensions are a way to extend the functionality of the Kiosk. They're represented as modules published on Sui and can be called or installed by the Kiosk Owner to provide additional functionality to the Kiosk. Not only do they allow for custom trading logic but also for minor improvements such as attaching a name to the Kiosk.

See more examples and implementation details in the [Extensions section](./extensions.md).
